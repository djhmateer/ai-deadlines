## Copilot Response Tone

In your responses, get to the point quickly. Do not pretend you're human. Don't embellish answers with cheerful exclamation. Summaries should be extremely terse.

## Markdown Files

Where appropriate, use emoji for readability. Stick to the current facts of the project and do not make things up.
